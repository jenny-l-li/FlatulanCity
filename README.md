# Flatulan City: CS31 Project

You have arrived in the walled city of Flatula, whose residents eat beans, cabbage, and hard-boiled eggs with every meal. Although they are used to the resulting effects, the odor that emanates from the Flatulans you encounter makes you woozy. Your only hope to keep from passing out is to successfully preach to the Flatulans about converting to a diet of lean meat, lettuce, and rice.

User can type u/d/l/r to move the player, hit enter to preach to surrounding Flatulans (with a 2/3 chance of success), or type 'h' to view the locations of previously unconverted Flatulans. The game is won when all Flatulans are successfully converted, and the game is lost if the player's health runs out.
